Phase 1 and Phase 2
An e-learning management system (LMS) is a software application that enables the delivery, management, and tracking of online educational courses and training programs. E-Learning is the use of electronic technology to access educational content outside of a conventional school environment. In most circumstances, it refers to an entirely online course or program. Our project will be identified as an online teaching business, with features such as course administration, user progress monitoring, and tools for evaluating student performance and progress. The primary purpose of this project is to provide all age range, particularly students, with the chance to learn new skills through the materials they will be presented to. Key goals: high quality at a low cost, learning at any time and from any location, and studying several times. This web application will be developed using XAMPP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP , SQL…

Features/objectives 
Ability to recall previously learned material: Subscribers can watch video courses as many times as they need and can come back and watch specific parts at any time.  Creative way to present lessons: This website offers a unique manner to give lectures, which will unquestionably improve instructors' teaching abilities.              Low cost: The platform is very cost efficient.                                                                                                                            
Specification:
-Flexible web-based learning experience –
-Ability to go through a guided curriculum or choose lessons on an as-needed basis 
-Ability to start learning anytime from anywhere 
-Ability to improve course quality according to learner’s feedback 

How it works:                                                                                                                                                          Our e-learning platform offers an easy-to-use online learning experience for students and learners. Simply register for an account, choose the course you wish to take, and begin your learning journey. You can watch video courses as many times as you need, and can come back and watch specific parts at any time.


The program will be split into two sections, with one administrator having complete control and the other user having restricted control.                              Admin and User, engage with the system in various ways.
The Admin will be able to add, remove, and alter the details of the user, courses, and lessons. He may utilize this application to view sales reports as well as checking the payment status.

The User has the ability to change his own profile and insert a profile picture. He will be able to acquire admin-published courses. The program allows the user to view the lessons of a paid course. The user can provide feedback. Feedback will help Admin to improve the quality of content or service. 
Agile development methodology will be used for this project.                                                                                                          Agile allows for incremental and iterative development, which is beneficial for e-learning applications as it allows for continuous feedback and improvements to be made as the project progresses.
