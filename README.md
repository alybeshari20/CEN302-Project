Software Engineering Project / Graduation Project
An e-learning management system (LMS) is a software application that enables the delivery, management, and tracking of online educational courses and training programs. E-Learning is the use of electronic technology to access educational content outside of a conventional school environment. In most circumstances, it refers to an entirely online course or program. Our project will be identified as an online teaching business, with features such as course administration, user progress monitoring, and tools for evaluating student performance and progress. The primary purpose of this project is to provide all age range, particularly students, with the chance to learn new skills through the materials they will be presented to.
